            With the Lark
        </h1>
        <p>
            Night is for sorrow and dawn is for joy,<br>
            Chasing the troubles that fret and annoy;<br>
            Darkness for sighing and daylight for song,--<br>
            Cheery and chaste the strain, heartfelt and strong.<br>
            All the night through, though I moan in the dark,<br>
            I wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
        </p>
